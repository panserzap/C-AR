# Unreal Engine 5 Project: Car Visualization in Augmented Reality

This project is a demonstration of using Unreal Engine 5 to create an augmented reality experience on HoloLens 2 that visualizes a car and allows the user to interact with it by changing its color using a hand menu and opening its door by air-tapping on it.
